# PythonFileOrganizer
A simple python file organizer to keep your download folder or any other folder tidy. The program sorts different categories of files according to their type, and puts them in particular folders and arranges them according to the date they were created(year and month).



## Usage/Examples

After You download the .exe file, when you run it a black dialogue box should appear asking you for the location of the directory you want to sort(look at image below for reference).

The Location address should look something like the following:

(D:\Chorme and edge downloads)

If you are having trouble finding this location you can do two things:

i ) In your desired directory choose any file and check the properties of it there you should find a title named locatiion and beside it will be the address of that directory.

ii ) You right-click the top bar of the window and that should show you the address and you can copy it and paste it(look at the image blow for reference).
